# Model-Optimization-Bias-Variance-Tradeoff-Cross-Validation-Subset-Selection

For the above model we have calculated error and we know that the capability of how the model can perform when an unseen data is injected, and then we have calculated Bias-variance Tradeoff. Further optimize the model we performed K-fold validation (K=10) and then come to know the optimal fold=3 and average score and finally we made optimal feature selection. From all this above technique we have optimized the model for the heart disease.
